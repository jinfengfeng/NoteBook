## 12.2 Context Free Grammars

CFG: also called **phrase structure** grammar, equivalent to Backus-Naur Form. 

Production/rule of CFG: left of arrow is a single non-terminal symbol expressing some cluster or generalization; right of the arrow is an ordered list of one or more terminals and non-terminals.

A CFG can be thought of in two ways: as a device for generating sentences, and as a device for assigning a structure to a given sentence.
